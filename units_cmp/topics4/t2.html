<h2>Logical to Physical Address Translation</h2>

<p>
In 8086 microprocessor, the logical address is converted into
a physical address to access memory. The logical address consists
of a segment address and an offset address.
</p>

<h3>Logical Address</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Segment Address : Offset</li>
    <li>Example: 2000H : 1000H</li>
</ul>

<h3>Physical Address Calculation</h3>
<p>
Physical Address = (Segment Address × 10H) + Offset
</p>

<h3>Example Calculation</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Segment = 2000H</li>
    <li>Offset = 1000H</li>
    <li>Physical Address = 20000H + 1000H = 21000H</li>
</ul>

<h3>Explanation</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Segment address is shifted left by 4 bits (multiplied by 10H)</li>
    <li>Offset is added to get final 20 bit physical address</li>
    <li>Allows access up to 1 MB memory</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
Logical to Physical Address Translation enables 8086 to access
1 MB memory using 16 bit segment and offset registers.
