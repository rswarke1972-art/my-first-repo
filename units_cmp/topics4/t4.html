<h2>Read Write Cycle Timing Diagram</h2>

<p>
The Read and Write cycle timing diagram of 8086 shows the sequence
of operations during memory or I/O read and write operations.
Each operation takes place in clock cycles called T-states.
</p>

<h3>T-States</h3>
<ul>
    <li>T1 – Address is placed on address bus</li>
    <li>T2 – Control signals are activated</li>
    <li>T3 – Data transfer takes place</li>
    <li>T4 – Operation completes</li>
</ul>

<h3>Read Cycle</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Address is sent to memory</li>
    <li>RD signal becomes active (low)</li>
    <li>Data is read from memory to processor</li>
</ul>

<h3>Write Cycle</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Address is sent to memory</li>
    <li>WR signal becomes active (low)</li>
    <li>Data is written from processor to memory</li>
</ul>

<h3>Important Signals</h3>
<ul>
    <li>RD – Read control signal</li>
    <li>WR – Write control signal</li>
    <li>M/IO – Memory or I/O selection</li>
    <li>ALE – Address Latch Enable</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
The timing diagram explains how the 8086 performs read and write
operations step by step using clock cycles and control signals.
