<h2>Address Mapping</h2>

<p>
Address Mapping is the process of assigning memory or I/O devices
to specific address ranges so that the microprocessor can identify
and access them correctly.
</p>

<h3>Purpose of Address Mapping</h3>
<ul>
    <li>To connect memory and I/O devices to processor</li>
    <li>To assign unique address ranges</li>
    <li>To avoid address conflicts</li>
</ul>

<h3>Types of Address Mapping</h3>

<h4>1. Memory Address Mapping</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Memory devices are assigned specific address ranges</li>
    <li>Processor uses address bus to select memory location</li>
</ul>

<h4>2. I/O Address Mapping</h4>
<ul>
    <li>I/O devices are assigned port addresses</li>
    <li>Uses IN and OUT instructions</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example</h3>
<ul>
    <li>ROM: 00000H – 1FFFFH</li>
    <li>RAM: 20000H – 3FFFFH</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
Address Mapping ensures proper communication between processor
and memory or I/O devices by assigning unique address spaces.
