<h2>Address Decoding</h2>

<p>
Address Decoding is the process of selecting a specific memory
or I/O device based on the address provided by the microprocessor.
It ensures that only the intended device responds to a given address.
</p>

<h3>Need for Address Decoding</h3>
<ul>
    <li>To identify correct memory or I/O device</li>
    <li>To prevent multiple devices from responding simultaneously</li>
    <li>To organize memory space properly</li>
</ul>

<h3>Types of Address Decoding</h3>

<h4>1. Full Address Decoding</h4>
<ul>
    <li>All address lines are used</li>
    <li>No overlapping of address space</li>
</ul>

<h4>2. Partial Address Decoding</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Only some address lines are used</li>
    <li>May cause address overlap</li>
</ul>

<h3>Working</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Uses logic gates or decoder ICs</li>
    <li>Generates chip select signals</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
Address Decoding ensures correct device selection in a microprocessor
system and plays an important role in memory organization.
