<h2>Even and Odd Memory Banks</h2>

<p>
In 8086, memory is divided into two banks: Even memory bank and
Odd memory bank. This arrangement allows the processor to access
16 bit data efficiently.
</p>

<h3>Even Memory Bank</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Stores data at even addresses (0, 2, 4, ...)</li>
    <li>Connected to lower 8 data lines (D0 – D7)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Odd Memory Bank</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Stores data at odd addresses (1, 3, 5, ...)</li>
    <li>Connected to higher 8 data lines (D8 – D15)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Working</h3>
<ul>
    <li>For 8 bit data, only one bank is used</li>
    <li>For 16 bit data at even address, both banks are used</li>
    <li>Uses A0 and BHE signals for bank selection</li>
</ul>

<h3>Advantages</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Improves data transfer speed</li>
    <li>Efficient 16 bit data access</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
Even and Odd memory banks allow 8086 to access 16 bit data
in a single operation, improving performance.
