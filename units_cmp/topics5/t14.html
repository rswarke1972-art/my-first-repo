<h2>Loosely Coupled Multiprocessor Systems</h2>

<p>
A Loosely Coupled Multiprocessor System consists of multiple
independent processors, each with its own local memory.
Processors communicate through a communication network.
</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Each processor has its own memory</li>
    <li>Communication through message passing</li>
    <li>No shared common memory</li>
</ul>

<h3>Advantages</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Highly scalable</li>
    <li>Less bus contention</li>
    <li>Failure of one processor does not affect others</li>
</ul>

<h3>Disadvantages</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Slower communication compared to shared memory systems</li>
    <li>Complex programming</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Cluster systems</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
Loosely Coupled Systems provide better scalability and fault
tolerance by using independent processors with separate memory.
