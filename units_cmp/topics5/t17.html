<h2>NUMA Architecture</h2>

<p>
NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) Architecture is a multiprocessor
system where each processor has its own local memory, and access
time varies depending on the memory location.
</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Distributed memory system</li>
    <li>Each processor has local memory</li>
    <li>Access to local memory is faster than remote memory</li>
</ul>

<h3>Advantages</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Better scalability</li>
    <li>Reduced memory contention</li>
    <li>Improved performance for large systems</li>
</ul>

<h3>Disadvantages</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Complex design</li>
    <li>Programming is more difficult</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
NUMA Architecture improves scalability by distributing memory,
but memory access time depends on location.
