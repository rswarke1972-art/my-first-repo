<h2>Closely Coupled Multiprocessor Systems</h2>

<p>
A Closely Coupled Multiprocessor System is a system in which
multiple processors share a common main memory and are
connected through a high-speed bus.
</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Shared main memory</li>
    <li>Common system bus</li>
    <li>High-speed communication between processors</li>
</ul>

<h3>Advantages</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Fast data sharing</li>
    <li>Better performance</li>
    <li>Efficient resource utilization</li>
</ul>

<h3>Disadvantages</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Limited scalability</li>
    <li>Bus contention may occur</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Symmetric Multiprocessor (SMP) systems</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
Closely Coupled Systems allow processors to communicate
quickly through shared memory, improving overall performance.
