<h2>Large Register File</h2>

<p>
A Large Register File refers to a processor design that
contains a large number of general purpose registers.
It reduces the need to access main memory frequently.
</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Many general purpose registers</li>
    <li>Faster data access compared to memory</li>
    <li>Used mainly in RISC architecture</li>
</ul>

<h3>Advantages</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Improves performance</li>
    <li>Reduces memory access time</li>
    <li>Supports efficient instruction execution</li>
</ul>

<h3>Disadvantages</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Increases hardware complexity</li>
    <li>Higher cost</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
A Large Register File enhances processor performance
by minimizing memory access and speeding up execution.
