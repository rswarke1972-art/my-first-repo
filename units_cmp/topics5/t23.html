<h2>RISC vs CISC</h2>

<p>
RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) and CISC (Complex Instruction
Set Computer) are two types of processor architectures that differ
in instruction design and execution.
</p>

<h3>RISC Architecture</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Simple and fixed-length instructions</li>
    <li>Large number of registers</li>
    <li>Load/Store architecture</li>
    <li>Faster execution per instruction</li>
</ul>

<h3>CISC Architecture</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Complex and variable-length instructions</li>
    <li>Fewer registers</li>
    <li>Memory-to-memory operations allowed</li>
    <li>Single instruction performs multiple tasks</li>
</ul>

<h3>Comparison</h3>
<ul>
    <li>RISC focuses on simplicity and speed</li>
    <li>CISC focuses on powerful instructions</li>
    <li>RISC programs may require more instructions</li>
    <li>CISC programs may require fewer instructions</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
RISC and CISC represent two different approaches to processor
design, each with its own advantages and trade-offs.
