<h2>Indexed Addressing Mode</h2>

<p>
In Indexed Addressing Mode, the effective address of the operand
is calculated by adding an index register to a displacement value.
It is mainly used for accessing elements of arrays.
</p>

<h3>Format</h3>
<p>
Instruction  Register, [Index Register + Displacement]
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<ul>
    <li>MOV AX, [SI + 1000H]</li>
    <li>MOV AL, [DI + 05H]</li>
</ul>

<p>
In the above examples, SI or DI acts as the index register,
and the displacement is added to get the effective address.
</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Uses index registers (SI or DI)</li>
    <li>Supports array operations</li>
    <li>Effective address is calculated during execution</li>
</ul>

<h3>Advantages</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Efficient for accessing array elements</li>
    <li>Flexible memory access</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
Indexed Addressing Mode is useful for handling arrays and data
structures by calculating memory addresses dynamically.
