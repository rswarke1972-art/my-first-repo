<h2>Based Addressing Mode</h2>

<p>
In Based Addressing Mode, the effective address of the operand
is obtained by adding a base register to a displacement value.
It is commonly used for accessing data structures.
</p>

<h3>Format</h3>
<p>
Instruction  Register, [Base Register + Displacement]
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<ul>
    <li>MOV AX, [BX + 2000H]</li>
    <li>MOV AL, [BP + 10H]</li>
</ul>

<p>
In the above examples, BX or BP acts as the base register.
The displacement is added to calculate the effective address.
</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Uses base registers (BX or BP)</li>
    <li>Effective address calculated during execution</li>
    <li>Useful for structured data access</li>
</ul>

<h3>Advantages</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Flexible memory addressing</li>
    <li>Efficient for handling data structures</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
Based Addressing Mode provides flexibility by using base registers
to calculate memory addresses dynamically.
