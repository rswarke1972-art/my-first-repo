<h2>Based Indexed Addressing Mode</h2>

<p>
In Based Indexed Addressing Mode, the effective address of the operand
is calculated by adding a base register and an index register.
It may also include a displacement.
</p>

<h3>Format</h3>
<p>
Instruction  Register, [Base Register + Index Register + Displacement]
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<ul>
    <li>MOV AX, [BX + SI]</li>
    <li>MOV AL, [BP + DI + 10H]</li>
</ul>

<p>
In the above examples, BX or BP acts as the base register,
SI or DI acts as the index register, and displacement is optional.
</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Uses both base and index registers</li>
    <li>Can include displacement</li>
    <li>Very flexible addressing mode</li>
</ul>

<h3>Advantages</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Efficient for complex data structures</li>
    <li>Useful for multi-dimensional arrays</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
Based Indexed Addressing Mode provides maximum flexibility in
address calculation by combining base register, index register,
and displacement.
