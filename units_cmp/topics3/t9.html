<h2>Indirect Addressing Mode</h2>

<p>
In Indirect Addressing Mode, the address of the operand is stored
in a register. The instruction refers to the register, and the
actual memory address is taken from that register.
</p>

<h3>Format</h3>
<p>
Instruction  Register, [Register]
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<ul>
    <li>MOV AX, [BX]</li>
    <li>MOV AL, [SI]</li>
</ul>

<p>
In the above examples, BX and SI contain the memory address
of the data.
</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Memory address is stored in a register</li>
    <li>Flexible addressing method</li>
    <li>Requires memory access</li>
</ul>

<h3>Advantages</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Allows dynamic memory access</li>
    <li>Useful for arrays and pointers</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
Indirect Addressing Mode provides flexibility by storing the
memory address inside a register instead of directly in the instruction.
