<h2>Immediate Addressing Mode</h2>

<p>
In Immediate Addressing Mode, the operand (data) is given directly
in the instruction itself. The data is a constant value and does not
refer to any memory location.
</p>

<h3>Format</h3>
<p>
Instruction  Destination, Data
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<ul>
    <li>MOV AX, 1234H</li>
    <li>MOV BL, 25H</li>
</ul>

<p>
In the above examples, 1234H and 25H are immediate data values.
</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Operand is part of instruction</li>
    <li>No memory address is required</li>
    <li>Fast execution</li>
</ul>

<h3>Advantages</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Simple and easy to use</li>
    <li>Faster than memory addressing modes</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
Immediate Addressing Mode is used when constant data is required
in the instruction. It provides faster execution because no
memory access is needed.
