    <h2>Carry Look Ahead Addition</h2>

    <p>
        Carry Look Ahead (CLA) adder is a type of fast adder that improves speed
        by reducing the time required for carry propagation.
    </p>

    <h3>Problem with Ripple Carry Adder</h3>
    <p>
        In a ripple carry adder, each bit must wait for the previous carry
        to be calculated. This causes delay and reduces speed.
    </p>

    <h3>CLA Working Principle</h3>
    <p>
        CLA uses <b>generate</b> and <b>propagate</b> signals to calculate carry
        in advance without waiting for previous carries.
    </p>

    <h3>Generate and Propagate</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Generate (Gi)</b> = Ai AND Bi</li>
        <li><b>Propagate (Pi)</b> = Ai XOR Bi</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Carry Formula</h3>
    <p>
        Carry for bit i is calculated as:
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Ci+1 = Gi + (Pi × Ci)</b>
    </p>

    <h3>Advantages of CLA</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Faster addition than ripple carry</li>
        <li>Reduces carry delay</li>
        <li>Used in high-speed processors</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>More complex circuit design</li>
        <li>More hardware required</li>
    </ul>
