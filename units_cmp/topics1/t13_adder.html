    <h2>Design of Adder and Fast Adder</h2>

    <p>
        Adders are digital circuits used to perform addition of binary numbers.
        They are an essential part of the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU).
    </p>

    <h3>1. Half Adder</h3>
    <p>
        Half Adder adds two binary bits and produces a sum and carry.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Inputs: A, B</li>
        <li>Outputs: Sum (S), Carry (C)</li>
        <li>Sum = A XOR B</li>
        <li>Carry = A AND B</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Full Adder</h3>
    <p>
        Full Adder adds three bits (A, B and Carry-in).
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Inputs: A, B, Carry-in</li>
        <li>Outputs: Sum, Carry-out</li>
        <li>Sum = A XOR B XOR Cin</li>
        <li>Carry-out = (A AND B) + (Cin AND (A XOR B))</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Ripple Carry Adder</h3>
    <p>
        Multiple full adders are connected in series to form a ripple carry adder.
        The carry output of one adder becomes the carry input of the next.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Fast Adder</h3>
    <p>
        Fast adders improve speed by reducing the time required for carry propagation.
        Carry Look Ahead Adder is a popular fast adder.
    </p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        Adder design is important for fast arithmetic operations in CPUs.
        Fast adders help increase overall performance.
