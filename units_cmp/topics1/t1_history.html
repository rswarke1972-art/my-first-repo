    <h2>A Brief History of Computers</h2>

    <p>
        The history of computers describes the development of computing devices
        from simple calculating machines to modern digital computers.
        Computers have evolved through several generations based on the
        technology used.
    </p>

    <h3>Early Computing Devices</h3>
    <p>
        Early devices such as the Abacus, Pascaline, and Analytical Engine
        were used to perform basic calculations. These machines were
        mechanical in nature.
    </p>

    <h3>Generations of Computers</h3>

    <h4>First Generation (1940 1956)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Used vacuum tubes</li>
        <li>Large size and high power consumption</li>
        <li>Examples: ENIAC, UNIVAC</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Second Generation (1956 1963)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Used transistors</li>
        <li>Smaller, faster, and more reliable</li>
        <li>Used assembly and high-level languages</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Third Generation (1964 1971)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Used integrated circuits (ICs)</li>
        <li>Improved speed and efficiency</li>
        <li>Operating systems were introduced</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Fourth Generation (1971 Present)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Used microprocessors</li>
        <li>Personal computers became common</li>
        <li>Examples: IBM PC, Apple computers</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Fifth Generation (Present & Future)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Based on Artificial Intelligence</li>
        <li>Includes machine learning and robotics</li>
        <li>Focus on high-speed and smart systems</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        Over time, computers have become faster, smaller, and more powerful.
        The evolution of computers continues with advancements in
        artificial intelligence and quantum computing.
