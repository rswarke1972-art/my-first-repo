    <h2>Addition and Subtraction of Signed Numbers</h2>

    <p>
        Signed numbers are numbers with a sign (+ or −).
        In computers, signed numbers are usually represented using
        <b>Two’s Complement</b> form.
    </p>

    <h3>Two’s Complement Representation</h3>
    <p>
        Two’s complement is a method used to represent negative numbers.
        It is easy to perform arithmetic operations using this method.
    </p>

    <h3>Addition of Signed Numbers</h3>
    <p>
        While adding two signed numbers:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Convert both numbers to two’s complement form</li>
        <li>Add them using binary addition</li>
        <li>If carry is generated, ignore the carry bit</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>
        Add +5 and −3 using 4-bit representation:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>+5 = 0101</li>
        <li>−3 = 1101 (two’s complement)</li>
        <li>Sum = 0101 + 1101 = 0010 = +2</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Subtraction of Signed Numbers</h3>
    <p>
        Subtraction is performed by adding the negative value.
        Example: A − B = A + (−B)
    </p>

    <h3>Overflow in Signed Addition</h3>
    <p>
        Overflow occurs when the result is outside the range of representation.
