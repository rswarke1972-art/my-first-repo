    <h2>Computer Components</h2>

    <p>
        A computer system is made up of several components that work together
        to perform tasks. These components are divided into hardware and
        software.
    </p>

    <h3>Main Computer Components</h3>

    <h4>1. Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h4>
    <p>
        CPU is the brain of the computer. It controls all operations and
        performs calculations and logic operations.
    </p>

    <h4>2. Memory</h4>
    <p>
        Memory stores data and instructions. It includes:
        <b>RAM</b> (temporary) and <b>ROM</b> (permanent).
    </p>

    <h4>3. Input Devices</h4>
    <p>
        Devices used to enter data into a computer.
        Example: Keyboard, Mouse, Scanner.
    </p>

    <h4>4. Output Devices</h4>
    <p>
        Devices used to display results.
        Example: Monitor, Printer, Speaker.
    </p>

    <h4>5. Storage Devices</h4>
    <p>
        Devices used to store data permanently.
        Example: HDD, SSD, Pen drive.
    </p>

    <h4>6. Motherboard</h4>
    <p>
        Main circuit board that connects all components.
    </p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        All components work together to execute instructions and provide
        desired results.
