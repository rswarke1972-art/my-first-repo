    <h2>Designing for Performance</h2>

    <p>
        Designing for performance refers to the techniques used to
        improve the speed and efficiency of a computer system.
        Performance depends on hardware as well as software factors.
    </p>

    <h3>Factors Affecting Performance</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Processor speed (clock rate)</li>
        <li>Instruction execution time</li>
        <li>Memory hierarchy</li>
        <li>Input/Output performance</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Performance Improvement Techniques</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Pipelining</b>  Allows multiple instructions to be processed simultaneously</li>
        <li><b>Parallel Processing</b>  Executes multiple tasks at the same time</li>
        <li><b>Cache Memory</b>  Reduces memory access time</li>
        <li><b>Instruction-Level Parallelism</b></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Hardware Considerations</h3>
    <p>
        High-speed processors, efficient memory systems,
        and advanced interconnection methods help improve
        overall system performance.
    </p>

    <h3>Software Considerations</h3>
    <p>
        Optimized algorithms, efficient compilers, and
        well-structured programs also play an important role
        in enhancing performance.
    </p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        Designing for performance ensures faster execution,
        better resource utilization, and improved user experience.
