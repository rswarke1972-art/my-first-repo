    <h2>Computer Functions and Interconnection</h2>

    <p>
        A computer system performs many functions such as processing data,
        storing information, and communicating with other devices.
        Interconnection is the method of connecting these components so that
        they can work together efficiently.
    </p>

    <h3>Main Functions of a Computer</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Input</b> – Accepts data from the user (keyboard, mouse, etc.)</li>
        <li><b>Processing</b> – Performs calculations and logical operations</li>
        <li><b>Storage</b> – Stores data and instructions</li>
        <li><b>Output</b> – Displays results to the user</li>
        <li><b>Control</b> – Controls the working of all components</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Interconnection</h3>
    <p>
        Interconnection is the method of linking all components like CPU,
        memory, and I/O devices so that data and instructions can be
        transferred smoothly.
    </p>

    <h3>Types of Interconnection</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Bus Interconnection</b> – Single communication path shared by all devices</li>
        <li><b>Point-to-Point Interconnection</b> – Direct connection between two devices</li>
        <li><b>Crossbar Switch</b> – Multiple paths for high speed communication</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Importance</h3>
    <p>
        Efficient interconnection improves data transfer speed and overall
        system performance.
