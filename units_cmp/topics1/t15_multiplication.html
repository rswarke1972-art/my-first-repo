    <h2>Multiplication of Positive Numbers</h2>

    <p>
        Multiplication in computers is done using binary numbers.
        The process is similar to decimal multiplication but uses binary digits.
    </p>

    <h3>Binary Multiplication Method</h3>
    <p>
        Each bit of the multiplier is multiplied with the multiplicand.
        Partial products are generated and shifted based on bit position.
    </p>

    <h3>Example (4-bit)</h3>
    <p>Multiply 0101 (5) × 0011 (3)</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Step 1: 0101 × 1 = 0101</li>
        <li>Step 2: 0101 × 1 (shift left 1) = 1010</li>
        <li>Step 3: Add partial products = 0101 + 1010 = 1111 (15)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Shift and Add Method</h3>
    <p>
        Multiplication can be implemented using shift and add logic in ALU.
        It is fast and easy to design.
    </p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        Multiplication of positive numbers is a basic function of ALU.
        It is performed using binary multiplication and shift-add method.
