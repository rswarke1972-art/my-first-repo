    <h2>Booth’s Algorithm</h2>

    <p>
        Booth’s Algorithm is a fast multiplication technique used for
        multiplying signed binary numbers.
        It reduces the number of required addition and subtraction steps.
    </p>

    <h3>How Booth’s Algorithm Works</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>It scans the multiplier from right to left.</li>
        <li>It uses a special register called <b>Q-1</b> which stores the previous bit.</li>
        <li>Based on the current bit and Q-1, it decides whether to add,
            subtract, or do nothing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Rules</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>If the last two bits are <b>01</b> → Add the multiplicand.</li>
        <li>If the last two bits are <b>10</b> → Subtract the multiplicand.</li>
        <li>If the last two bits are <b>00 or 11</b> → Do nothing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>
        Suppose multiplier = 3 (0011) and multiplicand = -4 (1100).
        Booth’s algorithm will efficiently perform multiplication using
        shifts and add/subtract operations.
    </p>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Works for signed numbers</li>
        <li>Reduces number of arithmetic operations</li>
        <li>Improves multiplication speed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        Booth’s Algorithm is widely used in computer arithmetic units
        for efficient signed multiplication.
