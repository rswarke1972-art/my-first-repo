    <h2>Bus Interconnection</h2>

    <p>
        Bus interconnection is a method of connecting different components of a
        computer system using a common communication path called a bus.
        A bus carries data, addresses, and control signals between components.
    </p>

    <h3>Main Parts of a Bus</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Data Bus</b> – Transfers data between CPU and memory.</li>
        <li><b>Address Bus</b> – Carries memory addresses.</li>
        <li><b>Control Bus</b> – Carries control signals like read/write.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Types of Bus Interconnection</h3>

    <h4>1. Single Bus System</h4>
    <p>
        All devices share one bus for data transfer.
        It is simple but slower due to congestion.
    </p>

    <h4>2. Multiple Bus System</h4>
    <p>
        Uses multiple buses to improve speed and reduce traffic.
    </p>

    <h4>3. Local Bus</h4>
    <p>
        A dedicated bus for high-speed devices like graphics cards.
    </p>

    <h3>Bus Performance Factors</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Bus width (number of lines)</li>
        <li>Bus speed (frequency)</li>
        <li>Number of devices connected</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        Bus interconnection is a simple and cost-effective way to connect
        computer components, but performance depends on bus width and speed.
