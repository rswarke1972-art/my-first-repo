    <h2>Interconnection Structure</h2>

    <p>
        Interconnection structure refers to the way different parts of a computer
        (CPU, memory, and I/O devices) are connected to communicate with each other.
        It determines the speed and efficiency of data transfer.
    </p>

    <h3>Main Types of Interconnection Structures</h3>

    <h4>1. Single Bus Structure</h4>
    <p>
        All components are connected through a single bus.
        This is simple and cost-effective.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Low cost</li>
        <li>Easy design</li>
        <li>But limited speed</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2. Multiple Bus Structure</h4>
    <p>
        Two or more buses are used for communication.
        It improves speed and reduces bus congestion.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Higher speed</li>
        <li>Better performance</li>
        <li>More complex design</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>3. Crossbar Switch Structure</h4>
    <p>
        Every device has its own dedicated path.
        It provides very high speed but is costly.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>High speed</li>
        <li>Complex and expensive</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        The interconnection structure is crucial for system performance,
        as it determines how quickly data can move between components.
