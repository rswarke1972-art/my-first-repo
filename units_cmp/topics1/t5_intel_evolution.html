    <h2>Evolution of Intel Processor Architecture (4-bit to 64-bit)</h2>

    <p>
        Intel processor architecture has evolved significantly over time,
        improving processing speed, data handling capability, and performance.
        This evolution is mainly categorized based on word size.
    </p>

    <h3>4-bit Processors</h3>
    <p>
        The first Intel processor, <b>Intel 4004</b>, was a 4-bit processor.
        It could process 4 bits of data at a time and was mainly used in
        calculators.
    </p>

    <h3>8-bit Processors</h3>
    <p>
        Intel introduced the <b>8080</b> and <b>8085</b> processors which were
        capable of processing 8 bits of data. These processors were widely
        used in early personal computers.
    </p>

    <h3>16-bit Processors</h3>
    <p>
        The <b>Intel 8086</b> and <b>8088</b> processors marked the beginning
        of the x86 architecture. They offered better performance and larger
        memory addressing.
    </p>

    <h3>32-bit Processors</h3>
    <p>
        Processors such as <b>Intel 80386</b> and <b>Pentium</b> introduced
        32-bit architecture, enabling multitasking, virtual memory, and
        advanced operating systems.
    </p>

    <h3>64-bit Processors</h3>
    <p>
        Modern processors like <b>Intel Core i-series</b> support 64-bit
        architecture, allowing large memory access, high-speed computation,
        and improved performance.
    </p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        The evolution from 4-bit to 64-bit processors reflects the continuous
        advancement in computer architecture to meet growing computational
        demands.
