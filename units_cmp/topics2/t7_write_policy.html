    <h2>Write Policy</h2>

    <p>
        Write policy defines how data is written into cache and main memory
        when the CPU performs a write operation.
    </p>

    <h3>Main Write Policies</h3>

    <h4>1. Write Through</h4>
    <p>
        In write-through, data is written to both cache and main memory
        at the same time.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Simple and safe</li>
        <li>Slower due to frequent memory writes</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2. Write Back (Write-Behind)</h4>
    <p>
        In write-back, data is written only to cache.
        Main memory is updated later when the cache block is replaced.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Faster because it reduces memory writes</li>
        <li>Needs additional hardware for tracking modified blocks</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        Write-back is faster but complex, while write-through is simple and reliable.
        Modern systems use a combination of both depending on requirements.
