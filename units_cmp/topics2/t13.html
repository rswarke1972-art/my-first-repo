<h2>Semiconductor Main Memory</h2>

<p>
Semiconductor main memory is the primary memory of a computer system.
It is made using semiconductor devices and is directly accessible by the CPU.
It stores programs and data currently being used.
</p>

<h3>Types of Semiconductor Main Memory</h3>

<h4>1. RAM (Random Access Memory)</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Volatile memory (data is lost when power is off)</li>
    <li>Read and write operations are allowed</li>
    <li>Used as main working memory</li>
</ul>

<h4>Types of RAM</h4>
<ul>
    <li><b>SRAM (Static RAM)</b> – Faster and more expensive</li>
    <li><b>DRAM (Dynamic RAM)</b> – Slower and cheaper</li>
</ul>

<h4>2. ROM (Read Only Memory)</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Non-volatile memory</li>
    <li>Stores permanent instructions</li>
    <li>Used for firmware and boot programs</li>
</ul>

<h3>Characteristics</h3>
<ul>
    <li>High speed compared to secondary storage</li>
    <li>Limited storage capacity</li>
    <li>Costlier than secondary memory</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
Semiconductor main memory plays an important role in computer
performance. It provides fast access to data and instructions required
by the CPU during execution.
