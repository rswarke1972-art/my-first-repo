    <h2>Line Size</h2>

    <p>
        Line size (also called block size) is the amount of data stored in one cache line.
        It is an important factor that affects cache performance.
    </p>

    <h3>How Line Size Works</h3>
    <p>
        Cache stores data in blocks. When a memory block is loaded into cache,
        the entire block (line) is copied, not just one byte.
    </p>

    <h3>Effect of Line Size</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Small line size</b> → fewer bytes per block</li>
        <li><b>Large line size</b> → more bytes per block</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Advantages of Large Line Size</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Better use of spatial locality</li>
        <li>Fewer cache misses if nearby data is needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages of Large Line Size</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Wastes space if nearby data is not used</li>
        <li>Increases memory transfer time</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        Line size should be chosen carefully to balance between cache hit rate and memory usage.
