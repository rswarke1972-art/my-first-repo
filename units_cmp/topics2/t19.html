<h2>RAID Level 4</h2>

<p>
RAID Level 4 uses block-level data striping with a dedicated parity disk.
Data is divided into blocks and distributed across multiple disks,
while one separate disk stores parity information.
</p>

<h3>Working of RAID 4</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Data is split into blocks</li>
    <li>Blocks are stored across multiple disks</li>
    <li>One dedicated disk stores parity</li>
    <li>If one disk fails, data can be reconstructed using parity</li>
</ul>

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Block-level striping</li>
    <li>Dedicated parity disk</li>
    <li>Supports independent read operations</li>
</ul>

<h3>Advantages</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Good read performance</li>
    <li>Provides fault tolerance</li>
    <li>Efficient for large files</li>
</ul>

<h3>Disadvantages</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Parity disk may become bottleneck during write operations</li>
    <li>Slower write performance</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
RAID Level 4 improves read performance and provides reliability using
a dedicated parity disk. However, the parity disk can limit write
performance in high workload systems.
