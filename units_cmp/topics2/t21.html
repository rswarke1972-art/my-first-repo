<h2>RAID Level 6</h2>

<p>
RAID Level 6 uses block-level data striping with double distributed parity.
It is similar to RAID 5, but it stores two parity blocks instead of one,
allowing the system to tolerate two disk failures.
</p>

<h3>Working of RAID 6</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Data is divided into blocks</li>
    <li>Blocks are distributed across multiple disks</li>
    <li>Two parity blocks are distributed among all disks</li>
    <li>Data can be recovered even if two disks fail</li>
</ul>

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Double parity protection</li>
    <li>No dedicated parity disk</li>
    <li>Requires minimum four disks</li>
</ul>

<h3>Advantages</h3>
<ul>
    <li>High fault tolerance</li>
    <li>Can survive two disk failures</li>
    <li>Good reliability for large storage systems</li>
</ul>

<h3>Disadvantages</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Slower write performance than RAID 5</li>
    <li>More complex implementation</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
RAID Level 6 provides higher reliability than RAID 5 by using
double parity. It is suitable for systems where data protection
is very important.
