<h2>RAID Level 1</h2>

<p>
RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) Level 1 is a disk
organization technique that provides data redundancy by using
mirroring. In RAID 1, the same data is written to two or more disks.
</p>

<h3>Working of RAID 1</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Data is duplicated on two disks</li>
    <li>Each disk contains an exact copy of the data</li>
    <li>If one disk fails, data can be recovered from the other disk</li>
</ul>

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>High reliability</li>
    <li>Simple implementation</li>
    <li>No data loss if one disk fails</li>
</ul>

<h3>Advantages</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Provides fault tolerance</li>
    <li>Fast read performance</li>
    <li>Easy data recovery</li>
</ul>

<h3>Disadvantages</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Storage capacity is reduced by half</li>
    <li>Higher cost due to extra disk</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
RAID Level 1 improves data reliability by storing duplicate copies of
data. It is commonly used in systems where data safety is more important
than storage efficiency.
