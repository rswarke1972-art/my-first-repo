<h2>Locality of Reference</h2>

<p>
Locality of reference is a principle which states that programs tend to
access a small portion of memory repeatedly for a short period of time.
This property helps in improving cache performance.
</p>

<h3>Types of Locality of Reference</h3>

<h4>1. Temporal Locality</h4>
<p>
If a memory location is accessed, it is likely to be accessed again soon.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Example: Variables inside loops</li>
    <li>Recently used data is reused</li>
</ul>

<h4>2. Spatial Locality</h4>
<p>
If a memory location is accessed, nearby memory locations are likely to
be accessed soon.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Example: Accessing elements of an array sequentially</li>
    <li>Adjacent memory locations are used</li>
</ul>

<h4>3. Sequential Locality</h4>
<p>
Instructions are generally executed sequentially, one after another.
</p>

<h3>Importance of Locality</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Improves cache efficiency</li>
    <li>Reduces memory access time</li>
    <li>Increases overall system performance</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
Locality of reference is the main reason why cache memory works
effectively. By storing recently and closely used data, cache reduces
the need to access slower main memory.
