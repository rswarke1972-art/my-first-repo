<h2>RAID Level 5</h2>

<p>
RAID Level 5 uses block-level data striping with distributed parity.
Unlike RAID 4, parity information is distributed across all disks
instead of being stored on a single dedicated disk.
</p>

<h3>Working of RAID 5</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Data is divided into blocks</li>
    <li>Blocks are distributed across multiple disks</li>
    <li>Parity is also distributed among all disks</li>
    <li>If one disk fails, data can be reconstructed using parity</li>
</ul>

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>No single parity disk</li>
    <li>Improved write performance compared to RAID 4</li>
    <li>Requires minimum three disks</li>
</ul>

<h3>Advantages</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Good read performance</li>
    <li>Better write performance than RAID 4</li>
    <li>Efficient use of storage</li>
    <li>Provides fault tolerance</li>
</ul>

<h3>Disadvantages</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Write operations are slower than RAID 0</li>
    <li>Can tolerate only one disk failure</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
RAID Level 5 is widely used because it provides a good balance
between performance, storage efficiency, and reliability.
