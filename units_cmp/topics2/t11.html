<h2>Two Level Cache</h2>

<p>
A two level cache system uses two separate cache memories to improve
performance. These are called Level 1 (L1) cache and Level 2 (L2) cache.
</p>

<h3>Need for Two Level Cache</h3>
<p>
As processor speed increased, a single cache was not enough to provide
data at the required speed. To reduce the average memory access time,
a second cache level was introduced.
</p>

<h3>Level 1 (L1) Cache</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Smallest and fastest cache memory</li>
    <li>Located inside the CPU</li>
    <li>Very low access time</li>
    <li>Stores frequently used instructions and data</li>
</ul>

<h3>Level 2 (L2) Cache</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Larger than L1 cache</li>
    <li>Slower than L1 but faster than main memory</li>
    <li>May be inside or outside the CPU</li>
    <li>Acts as backup cache for L1</li>
</ul>

<h3>Working of Two Level Cache</h3>
<p>
When the CPU needs data:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>First, it checks L1 cache.</li>
    <li>If data is found (cache hit), it is used immediately.</li>
    <li>If not found (cache miss), it checks L2 cache.</li>
    <li>If still not found, data is fetched from main memory.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Advantages</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Improves system performance</li>
    <li>Reduces average memory access time</li>
    <li>Better handling of large programs</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
Two level cache systems improve efficiency by combining a small fast
cache (L1) with a larger slower cache (L2), reducing the need to access
main memory frequently.
