<h2>Advanced DRAM Organization</h2>

<p>
Advanced DRAM organization refers to improvements made in Dynamic
Random Access Memory (DRAM) to increase speed, efficiency, and performance.
Modern systems use advanced DRAM structures to support high-speed processors.
</p>

<h3>Need for Advanced DRAM</h3>
<ul>
    <li>To reduce memory access time</li>
    <li>To support high-speed CPUs</li>
    <li>To improve data transfer rate</li>
</ul>

<h3>Types of Advanced DRAM</h3>

<h4>1. SDRAM (Synchronous DRAM)</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Operates in synchronization with system clock</li>
    <li>Faster than conventional DRAM</li>
</ul>

<h4>2. DDR SDRAM (Double Data Rate SDRAM)</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Transfers data on both rising and falling clock edges</li>
    <li>Higher data transfer rate</li>
    <li>Versions: DDR2, DDR3, DDR4, DDR5</li>
</ul>

<h4>3. RDRAM (Rambus DRAM)</h4>
<ul>
    <li>High-speed memory architecture</li>
    <li>Uses special high-speed data bus</li>
</ul>

<h3>Features of Advanced DRAM</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Higher bandwidth</li>
    <li>Improved performance</li>
    <li>Better power efficiency</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
Advanced DRAM organization enhances memory performance by increasing
data transfer speed and reducing latency. It plays an important role in
modern computer systems.
