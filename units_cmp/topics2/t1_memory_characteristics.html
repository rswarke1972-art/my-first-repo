    <h2>Characteristics of Memory System</h2>

    <p>
        Memory system is a combination of different memory devices used to store
        data and instructions. The main goal of a memory system is to provide
        fast and reliable access to data.
    </p>

    <h3>Important Characteristics</h3>

    <h4>1. Capacity</h4>
    <p>
        Capacity refers to the amount of data a memory can store.
        It is usually measured in bytes (KB, MB, GB).
    </p>

    <h4>2. Speed</h4>
    <p>
        Speed is the time required to read or write data.
        Faster memory improves system performance.
    </p>

    <h4>3. Cost</h4>
    <p>
        Cost is an important factor. Faster memory is more expensive.
        Therefore, a balance between cost and speed is required.
    </p>

    <h4>4. Volatility</h4>
    <p>
        Volatile memory loses data when power is off (e.g., RAM).
        Non-volatile memory retains data without power (e.g., ROM, SSD).
    </p>

    <h4>5. Reliability</h4>
    <p>
        Reliability means the ability of memory to store data without errors.
        Error correction codes (ECC) are used for reliable memory.
    </p>

    <h4>6. Access Time</h4>
    <p>
        Access time is the time required to access a specific memory location.
        Lower access time means faster memory.
    </p>

    <h4>7. Bandwidth</h4>
    <p>
        Bandwidth is the amount of data transferred per second.
        Higher bandwidth increases data transfer speed.
    </p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        A good memory system must balance capacity, speed, cost, and reliability.
        Memory hierarchy is designed to achieve this balance.
