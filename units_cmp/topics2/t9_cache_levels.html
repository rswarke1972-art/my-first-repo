    <h2>Number of Cache Levels</h2>

    <p>
        Modern computer systems use multiple levels of cache memory.
        Each level differs in size, speed, and distance from the CPU.
    </p>

    <h3>Cache Levels</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><b>L1 Cache</b> – Smallest and fastest cache located inside CPU</li>
        <li><b>L2 Cache</b> – Larger than L1 but slower, usually inside CPU</li>
        <li><b>L3 Cache</b> – Even larger and slower, shared between CPU cores</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why Multiple Cache Levels?</h3>
    <p>
        A single cache cannot satisfy both high speed and large capacity.
        Multiple levels provide a balance between speed and size.
    </p>

    <h3>How Cache Levels Work</h3>
    <p>
        When CPU searches for data:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>If found in L1 → <b>Fastest</b></li>
        <li>If not found → search L2</li>
        <li>If not found → search L3</li>
        <li>If still not found → access main memory</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        Multi-level cache improves performance by providing fast access to frequently used data.
