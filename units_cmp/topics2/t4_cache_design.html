    <h2>Elements of Cache Design</h2>

    <p>
        Cache design is important to improve system performance.
        The main goal of cache is to reduce memory access time by storing
        frequently used data.
    </p>

    <h3>Main Elements of Cache Design</h3>

    <h4>1. Cache Size</h4>
    <p>
        Cache size determines how much data the cache can store.
        Larger cache improves hit rate but increases cost.
    </p>

    <h4>2. Block Size (Line Size)</h4>
    <p>
        Cache stores data in blocks or lines.
        Block size determines how many bytes are stored in one cache block.
    </p>

    <h4>3. Mapping Technique</h4>
    <p>
        Mapping determines how a block from main memory is placed into cache.
        There are 3 mapping techniques:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Direct Mapping</b></li>
        <li><b>Fully Associative Mapping</b></li>
        <li><b>Set Associative Mapping</b></li>
    </ul>

    <h4>4. Replacement Policy</h4>
    <p>
        When cache is full, replacement policy decides which block to remove.
        Common policies are:
        <b>LRU, FIFO, Random</b>.
    </p>

    <h4>5. Write Policy</h4>
    <p>
        Write policy determines how data is written into cache and main memory.
        Two common policies are:
        <b>Write Through</b> and <b>Write Back</b>.
    </p>

    <h4>6. Cache Levels</h4>
    <p>
        Modern systems use multiple cache levels (L1, L2, L3).
        Each level differs in size and speed.
    </p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        Cache design affects the performance of CPU and memory system.
        Proper cache size, mapping, and replacement policy improves speed.
