    <h2>Replacement Algorithms</h2>

    <p>
        When the cache is full and a new block needs to be loaded,
        the system must decide which existing block should be removed.
        The rule used for this decision is called a replacement algorithm.
    </p>

    <h3>Common Replacement Algorithms</h3>

    <h4>1. Least Recently Used (LRU)</h4>
    <p>
        LRU removes the block that has not been used for the longest time.
        It assumes that recently used blocks will be used again soon.
    </p>

    <h4>2. First In First Out (FIFO)</h4>
    <p>
        FIFO removes the oldest block in cache (first stored).
        It is simple but may remove frequently used data.
    </p>

    <h4>3. Random Replacement</h4>
    <p>
        Randomly selects a block to remove.
        Simple but not always efficient.
    </p>

    <h4>4. Least Frequently Used (LFU)</h4>
    <p>
        Removes the block that is used least frequently.
        It counts how many times each block is used.
    </p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        Replacement algorithms help improve cache performance.
        LRU is the most commonly used algorithm in modern systems.
