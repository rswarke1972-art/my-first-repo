    <h2>Cache Memory Principles</h2>

    <p>
        Cache memory is a small and very fast memory placed between the CPU and main memory.
        It stores frequently used data and instructions to reduce access time and improve performance.
    </p>

    <h3>Main Principles of Cache Memory</h3>

    <h4>1. Temporal Locality</h4>
    <p>
        Recently accessed data is likely to be accessed again soon.
        Cache stores these data so they can be reused quickly.
    </p>

    <h4>2. Spatial Locality</h4>
    <p>
        Data located near recently accessed data is likely to be accessed soon.
        Cache stores blocks of data instead of single bytes.
    </p>

    <h4>3. Cache Hit</h4>
    <p>
        When the CPU finds requested data in cache, it is called a cache hit.
        Hit reduces memory access time significantly.
    </p>

    <h4>4. Cache Miss</h4>
    <p>
        When the data is not found in cache, it is called a cache miss.
        Data must be fetched from main memory, causing delay.
    </p>

    <h3>Cache Block</h3>
    <p>
        Cache stores data in blocks (also called lines).  
        Each block contains multiple bytes of data.
    </p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        Cache memory improves computer performance by storing frequently used data
        and reducing the time needed to access main memory.
