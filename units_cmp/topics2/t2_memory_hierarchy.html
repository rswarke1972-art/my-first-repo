    <h2>Memory Hierarchy</h2>

    <p>
        Memory hierarchy is a structure that uses different types of memory
        devices arranged in levels. Each level has different speed, size, and cost.
        The main idea is to provide fast access to frequently used data while keeping
        large capacity at a low cost.
    </p>

    <h3>Levels of Memory Hierarchy</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Registers</b> – Smallest and fastest memory inside CPU</li>
        <li><b>Cache Memory</b> – Very fast memory placed near CPU</li>
        <li><b>Main Memory (RAM)</b> – Larger but slower than cache</li>
        <li><b>Secondary Storage</b> – HDD, SSD (large capacity, slower)</li>
        <li><b>Offline Storage</b> – Tapes, external drives (very large capacity)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why Memory Hierarchy is Used?</h3>
    <p>
        It is impossible to use only fast memory because it is very expensive.
        Memory hierarchy balances speed and cost by using small fast memory
        with large slow memory.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Hit</b> – Data is found in faster memory (cache)</li>
        <li><b>Miss</b> – Data is not found in cache and must be fetched from main memory</li>
        <li><b>Locality</b> – Program uses data located near previously used data</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        Memory hierarchy improves performance by keeping frequently used data
        in faster memory levels while storing the rest in slower, larger memory.
