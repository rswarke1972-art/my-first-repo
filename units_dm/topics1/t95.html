<h2>Countable and Uncountable Sets</h2>

<p>
Sets are classified as countable or uncountable
based on whether their elements can be listed
in a sequence.
</p>

<h3>Countable Set</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Elements can be listed in sequence</li>
    <li>Can form one-to-one correspondence with natural numbers</li>
    <li>Example: Natural numbers, Integers</li>
</ul>

<h3>Uncountable Set</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Elements cannot be listed completely</li>
    <li>No one-to-one correspondence with natural numbers</li>
    <li>Example: Real numbers</li>
</ul>

<h3>Finite and Infinite Countable Sets</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Finite sets are countable</li>
    <li>Infinite sets like natural numbers are also countable</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
Countable sets can be listed,
while uncountable sets are too large
to be listed completely.
