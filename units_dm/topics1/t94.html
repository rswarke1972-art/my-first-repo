<h2>Diagonalization Argument</h2>

<p>
The Diagonalization Argument, introduced by
Georg Cantor, is used to prove that some sets
are uncountable.
</p>

<h3>Main Idea</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Assume a list of elements exists</li>
    <li>Create a new element by changing diagonal values</li>
    <li>The new element is not in the list</li>
</ul>

<h3>Application</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Proves real numbers are uncountable</li>
    <li>Shows infinity has different sizes</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>
Used to prove that real numbers
between 0 and 1 cannot be listed completely.
</p>

<h3>Importance</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Foundation of set theory</li>
    <li>Important in theoretical computer science</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
Diagonalization proves that
some infinite sets are larger than others.
