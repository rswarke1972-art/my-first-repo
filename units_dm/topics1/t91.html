<h2>Cardinality of Set</h2>

<p>
Cardinality of a set refers to the number of elements
present in the set. It is denoted by |A|.
</p>

<h3>Finite Set</h3>
<ul>
    <li>A set with limited number of elements</li>
    <li>Example: A = {1,2,3}</li>
    <li>|A| = 3</li>
</ul>

<h3>Infinite Set</h3>
<ul>
    <li>A set with unlimited elements</li>
    <li>Example: Natural numbers</li>
</ul>

<h3>Equal Cardinality</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Two sets have equal cardinality
        if there is one-to-one correspondence
        between their elements</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>
If A = {1,2,3} and B = {a,b,c},
then |A| = |B| = 3
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
Cardinality measures the size
of a set in terms of number of elements.
