<h2>Pigeonhole Principle</h2>

<p>
The Pigeonhole Principle states that
if more objects are placed into fewer boxes,
at least one box must contain more than one object.
</p>

<h3>Basic Form</h3>
<ul>
    <li>If n objects are placed into m boxes
        and n > m,
        then at least one box contains
        at least two objects.</li>
</ul>

<h3>General Form</h3>
<p>
If n objects are placed into m boxes,
then at least one box contains
at least ⌈n/m⌉ objects.
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>
If 13 people are in a room,
at least two share the same birth month.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
The Pigeonhole Principle guarantees
repetition when items exceed containers.
