<h2>Addition Principle</h2>

<p>
The Addition Principle states that
if one task can be done in m ways
and another independent task can be done in n ways,
then either of the tasks can be done in (m + n) ways.
</p>

<h3>Condition</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Tasks must be mutually exclusive</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>
If there are 3 math books and 2 physics books,
you can choose one book in 3 + 2 = 5 ways.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
Addition principle is used when
choices do not overlap.
