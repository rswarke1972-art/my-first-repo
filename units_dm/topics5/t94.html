<h2>Groups</h2>

<p>
A Group is an algebraic structure
that consists of a set with a binary operation
satisfying certain properties.
</p>

<h3>Definition</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Closure: For all a, b ∈ G, a * b ∈ G</li>
    <li>Associativity: (a * b) * c = a * (b * c)</li>
    <li>Identity Element: There exists e such that a * e = e * a = a</li>
    <li>Inverse Element: For every a ∈ G, there exists b such that a * b = e</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>
(Set of integers, +)
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Identity = 0</li>
    <li>Inverse of a = -a</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
A group has closure, associativity,
identity, and inverse properties.
