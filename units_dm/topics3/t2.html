<h2>Properties of Trees</h2>

<p>
Trees have several important mathematical
properties that distinguish them from
other types of graphs.
</p>

<h3>Main Properties</h3>
<ul>
    <li>A tree with n vertices has exactly n - 1 edges</li>
    <li>There is exactly one simple path between any two vertices</li>
    <li>A tree is connected and acyclic</li>
    <li>Adding one edge creates a cycle</li>
    <li>Removing one edge disconnects the tree</li>
</ul>

<h3>Leaf Nodes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>A tree with at least two vertices
        has at least two leaf nodes</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
These properties help identify
and analyze tree structures in graph theory.
