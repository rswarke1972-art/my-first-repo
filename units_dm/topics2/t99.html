<h2>Counting Functions</h2>

<p>
Counting functions are used to determine
the number of possible functions between two sets.
</p>

<h3>Number of Functions</h3>
<ul>
    <li>If |A| = m and |B| = n</li>
    <li>Total number of functions from A to B = n^m</li>
</ul>

<h3>Injective Functions</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Possible only if m ≤ n</li>
    <li>Number = nPm (permutations)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Surjective Functions</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Every element of B must have pre-image</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>
If A has 2 elements and B has 3 elements,
number of functions = 3² = 9
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
Counting functions helps analyze
possible mappings between sets.
