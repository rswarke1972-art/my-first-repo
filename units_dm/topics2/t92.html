<h2>Transitive Closure</h2>

<p>
The Transitive Closure of a relation R
is the smallest transitive relation
that contains R.
</p>

<h3>Meaning</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Add pairs to relation to make it transitive</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>
If R = {(1,2), (2,3)}
</p>

<p>
Since (1,2) and (2,3) exist,
we must add (1,3) to make it transitive.
</p>

<p>
Transitive Closure = {(1,2), (2,3), (1,3)}
</p>

<h3>Importance</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Used in graph theory</li>
    <li>Used in database queries</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
Transitive closure ensures that
all indirect relationships are included.
