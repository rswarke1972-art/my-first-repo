<h2>Introduction to Relations</h2>

<p>
A relation is a connection between elements
of two sets. It is defined as a subset
of the Cartesian product of two sets.
</p>

<h3>Definition</h3>
<ul>
    <li>If A and B are sets, a relation R from A to B
        is a subset of A × B</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>
A = {1, 2}  
B = {a, b}
</p>

<p>
A × B = {(1,a), (1,b), (2,a), (2,b)}
</p>

<p>
R = {(1,a), (2,b)}
</p>

<h3>Domain and Range</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Domain: First elements of ordered pairs</li>
    <li>Range: Second elements of ordered pairs</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
Relations define associations between
elements of different sets.
