<h2>Representation using Digraphs</h2>

<p>
A relation on a set can also be represented
using a directed graph (digraph).
</p>

<h3>Digraph Representation</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Each element of the set is represented as a node</li>
    <li>An arrow (directed edge) from a to b
        represents (a, b) ∈ R</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>
If A = {1, 2, 3}  
R = {(1,2), (2,3)}
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Draw arrow from 1 → 2</li>
    <li>Draw arrow from 2 → 3</li>
</ul>

<h3>Advantages</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Visual representation</li>
    <li>Easy to understand properties like transitivity</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
Digraphs provide a graphical way
to represent and analyze relations.
