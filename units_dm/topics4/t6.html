<h2>Euler Paths</h2>

<p>
An Euler Path is a path in a graph
that visits every edge exactly once.
</p>

<h3>Euler Circuit</h3>
<ul>
    <li>An Euler Path that starts and ends
        at the same vertex</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conditions for Undirected Graph</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Euler Circuit: All vertices have even degree</li>
    <li>Euler Path: Exactly two vertices have odd degree</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>
If a graph has 0 or 2 vertices
with odd degree, it has an Euler Path.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
Euler paths traverse every edge once
without repetition.
