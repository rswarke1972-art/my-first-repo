<h2>Connectivity</h2>

<p>
A graph is said to be connected
if there is a path between every
pair of vertices.
</p>

<h3>Types of Connectivity</h3>

<h4>1. Connected Graph</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Every vertex is reachable from every other vertex</li>
</ul>

<h4>2. Disconnected Graph</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Some vertices are not connected</li>
</ul>

<h4>3. Strongly Connected (Directed Graph)</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Every vertex is reachable from every other vertex</li>
</ul>

<h3>Components</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Connected Component – Maximal connected subgraph</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
Connectivity determines whether
all vertices in a graph are reachable.
