<h2>Graph Terminology</h2>

<p>
A Graph is a mathematical structure
used to represent relationships
between objects.
</p>

<h3>Basic Terms</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Vertex (Node) – Represents an object</li>
    <li>Edge – Connects two vertices</li>
    <li>Degree – Number of edges incident to a vertex</li>
    <li>Adjacent Vertices – Vertices connected by an edge</li>
    <li>Path – Sequence of vertices connected by edges</li>
    <li>Cycle – Path that starts and ends at same vertex</li>
</ul>

<h3>Types of Graphs</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Directed Graph (Digraph)</li>
    <li>Undirected Graph</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
Graph terminology helps understand
the structure and properties of graphs.
