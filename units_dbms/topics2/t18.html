<h2>Group By and Having Clause</h2>

<p>
The GROUP BY clause is used to group rows that have the same
values in specified columns. The HAVING clause is used to
filter groups based on conditions.
</p>

<h3>GROUP BY</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Used with aggregate functions</li>
    <li>Groups rows with same values</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>
SELECT Age, COUNT(*)  
FROM Student  
GROUP BY Age;
</p>

<h3>HAVING Clause</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Used to filter grouped data</li>
    <li>Works with GROUP BY</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example with HAVING</h3>
<p>
SELECT Age, COUNT(*)  
FROM Student  
GROUP BY Age  
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
</p>

<h3>Difference Between WHERE and HAVING</h3>
<ul>
    <li>WHERE filters rows before grouping</li>
    <li>HAVING filters groups after grouping</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
GROUP BY and HAVING are used together
to organize and filter grouped data.
