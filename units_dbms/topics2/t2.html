<h2>Set</h2>

<p>
In SQL, a set represents a collection of rows returned
by a query. Set operations are used to combine results
from multiple SELECT statements.

    <li>Columns must have same number and data types for set operations</li>

</ul>

which can be combined with other sets using set operations.
