<h2>CAP Theorem and BASE Properties</h2>

<p>
The CAP Theorem explains the limitations of distributed
database systems. BASE properties are used in NoSQL
systems as an alternative to ACID.
</p>

<h3>CAP Theorem</h3>
<p>
A distributed system can guarantee only two
out of the following three properties:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Consistency (C)</b> – All nodes see the same data</li>
    <li><b>Availability (A)</b> – System always responds to requests</li>
    <li><b>Partition Tolerance (P)</b> – System works despite network failure</li>
</ul>

<h3>BASE Properties</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Basically Available</b> – System guarantees availability</li>
    <li><b>Soft State</b> – Data may change over time</li>
    <li><b>Eventually Consistent</b> – Data becomes consistent eventually</li>
</ul>

<h3>Difference from ACID</h3>
<ul>
    <li>ACID ensures strict consistency</li>
    <li>BASE focuses on availability and scalability</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
CAP Theorem defines trade-offs in distributed systems,
while BASE provides flexible consistency models
for NoSQL databases.
