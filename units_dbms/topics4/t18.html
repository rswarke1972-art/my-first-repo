<h2>Recoverable and Non-recoverable Schedules</h2>

<p>
Schedules are classified based on whether they
allow safe recovery from transaction failures.
</p>

<h3>1. Recoverable Schedule</h3>
<ul>
    <li>If T2 reads data written by T1,
        then T2 commits only after T1 commits</li>
    <li>Ensures safe recovery</li>
</ul>

<h4>Example</h4>
<p>
T1: Write(A) → Commit  
T2: Read(A) → Commit
</p>

<h3>2. Non-recoverable Schedule</h3>
<ul>
    <li>T2 commits before T1 commits</li>
    <li>If T1 aborts, recovery becomes impossible</li>
</ul>

<h4>Example</h4>
<p>
T1: Write(A)  
T2: Read(A) → Commit  
T1: Abort
</p>

<h3>Importance</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Recoverable schedules prevent inconsistencies</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
Recoverable schedules ensure safe transaction
execution, while non-recoverable schedules
may lead to data inconsistency.
