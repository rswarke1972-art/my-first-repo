Forest Fire Detection systems use IoT
to identify fire hazards at an early stage
and prevent large-scale damage.
</p>

<h3>How It Works</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Temperature and smoke sensors monitor forest areas</li>
    <li>Data is sent to control centers</li>
    <li>Alerts are generated in case of abnormal readings</li>
</ul>

<h3>Benefits</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Early fire detection</li>
    <li>Reduced environmental damage</li>
    <li>Improved disaster response</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
